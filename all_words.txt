only
liked
a
lot
of
things
before
i
knew
the
way
i
love
it
when
you
touch
me
now
rakim
remembers
remember
that
turn
the
beat
up
i
get
lost
in
the
mind
come
across
the
rhyme
kick
my
feet
up
then
i
find
myself
in
time
i
was
on
a
train
destination
marley
marl's
domain
i
entertained
things'll
never
be
the
same
dj's
are
conveyed
if
the
label
ok
it
teddy
ted
and
special
k
was
the
first
ones
to
play
it
on
the
radio
with
the
crazy
flow
i
pay
dues
until
it
pays
me
dough
to
do
a
show
when
i'm
at
the
helm
i
cover
the
whole
realm
in
control
and
leave
your
soul
overwhelmed
under
the
influence
of
beats
and
instruments
lyrics
make
it
intricate
and
elements
are
tense
when
you
was
playin
pac
man
it
was
the
jams
i
packed
peeps
would
swarm
when
i
was
performing
black
i'm
all
that
back
before
they
turned
hip-hop
to
rap
it
always
a
place
to
party
at
remember
that
i
remember
the
spots
that
used
to
be
hot
just
like
the
roof
top
a
place
that
only
few
can
rock
on
a
wild
ass
block
yeah
you
find
me
there
a
lot
until
you
hear
gunshots
that's
when
the
fun
stops
here
come
the
cops
time
to
go
home
get
in
order
cause
i'll
be
back
in
manhattan
if
somethings
happenin
at
the
latin
quarter
house
of
havoc
when
it
came
to
fourteen
carat
and
if
you
had
it
yeah
kids'd
try
to
grab
it
it's
cool
at
the
red
parrot
we
was
doin
it
there
i
was
the
first
one
to
rip
it
at
the
union
square
me
and
dj
red
alert
did
work
a
crazy
concert
a
lot
of
kids
got
hurt
i
did
encores
at
the
encore
they
wanted
more
i
kicked
a
freestyle
til
i
heard
the
crowd
roar
like
the
funhouse
bronx
center
never
endin
black
place
to
be
was
the
brooklyn
armory
remember
that
open
the
door
let
the
crowds
in
over
twenty
thousand
wildin
music's
loud
and
microphone's
growlin
tickets
are
sold
out
parties
is
packed
and
on
tour
rippin
basketball
arenas
back
then
even
after-parties
posses
of
players
and
hotties
everybody
was
gotti
spreadin
bucks
like
shotties
spendin
cash
to
make
a
good
time
last
thoughts
that
i
had
give
me
a
blast
of
the
past
memories
of
unforgettable
times
on
my
mind
dollar
signs
and
melodies
and
incredible
rhymes
the
people
i
met
and
the
sets
that
got
wrecked
all
the
mics
i
checked
most
of
all
life's
effects
and
peace
to
all
the
people
i
grew
up
around
in
the
streets
back
when
beats
had
a
rougher
sound
i
used
to
be
wild
me
and
my
crew
sit
back
and
we
smile
keep
piles
of
pictures
filed
in
case
i
go
senile
cause
some
things
are
just
too
good
to
be
forgot
like
your
neighborhood
block
or
your
favorite
spot
certain
records
always
seem
to
make
me
reminisce
and
when
it
hits
and
then
it
clicks
remember
this
my
life
flashed
before
me
i'm
there
from
the
sounds
i
hear
pinpoint
the
year
it's
perfectly
clear
i
like
the
way
it
went
down
and
alla
that
in
fact
it
mean
a
lot
cause
you
can't
bring
it
back
remember
that
i
moved
miles
and
miles
to
get
out
of
your
space
but
i
still
see
your smile, still
on
every face
and
i
bring
all
of
the shit
i
got
from
you
now
whenever
i
move
on
to
someone
new
now
i
look
out
for
your
grey
car
when
i'm
out
on
the
road
and
when
i
roll
the
paper
it's
the
way
that
you
showed
and
i
wear
all
of
the
habits
that
you
gave
me
right
next
to
all
the
crazy
that
you
made
me
i
never
wanna
never
wanna
never
wanna
think
about
you
again
but
i
do
sometimes
i
never
wanna

about
you
again

used
to
be

was
never
afraid
i
put
all
my
trust
in
a
feeling
when
somebody
said
love
i
believed
it
now
i
wear
all
of
the
habits
that
you
gave
me
right
next
to
all
the

now
that
it's

made

stars

the
sky

been
running
through
the
jungle
i've
been
running
with
the
wolves
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
i've
been
down
the
darkest
alleys
saw
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
i've
looked
for
love
in
every
stranger
took
too
much
to
ease
the
anger
all
for
you
yeah
all
for
you
i've
been
running
through
the
jungle
i've
been
crying
with
the
wolves
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
to
get
to
you
your
fingertips
trace
my
skin
to
places
i
have
never
been
blindly
i
am
following
break
down
these
walls
and
come
on
in
i
wanna
feel
the
way
that
we
did

i'd
rather
be
a
lover
than
a
fighter
fighter
cause
all
my
life
i've
been
fighting
never
felt
a
feeling
of
comfort
oh
and
all
this
time
i've
been
hiding
and
i
never
had
someone
to
call
my
own
oh
nah
i'm
so
used
to
sharing
love
only
left
me
alone
but
i'm
at
one
with
the
silence
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at
one
and
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at
one
and
i've
been
silent
for
too
long
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at
one
and
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i'm
in
need
of
a
savior
savior
but
i'm
not
asking
for
favors
my
whole
life
i've
felt
like
a
burden
i
think
too
much
and
i
hate
it
i'm
so
used
to
being
in
the
wrong
i'm
tired
of
caring
loving
never
gave
me
a
home
so
i'll
sit
here
in
the
silence
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at
one
and
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at
one
and
i've
been
silent
for
too
long
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i've
been
quiet
for
too
long
i
found
peace
in
your
violence
can't
tell
me
there's
no
point
in
trying
i'm
at

memories
are
fading
though
it's
only
been
a
week
all
the
little
things
are
gone
the
things
we
used
to
be
nobody
could
take
us
down
there
was
only
you
and
me
and
without
you
i
can't
be
you're
the
universe
to
me
you're
the
air
in
my
lungs
you're
the
fields
where
i
run
you're
the
sky
where
i'm
floating
it's
you
you
you
it's
you
woah
and
without
you
i
can't
be
you're
the
universe
to
me
you're
the
air
in
my
lungs
you're
the
fields
where
i
run
you're
the
sky
where
i'm
floating
it's
you
you
you
you
it's
you
woah

want
to
be
a
stranger

the
one
you
need
i

on
the
sidewalk
innocent
remember

was
care
for
each
other
but
the
night
was
warm
we
were
bold
and
young
all
around
the
wind
blows
we
would
only
hold
on
to
let
go
blow
a
kiss
fire
a
gun

road
will
you
be
there
by
my
side
standing
strong
as
the
waves
roll
over
when
the
nights
are
long
longing
for
you
to
come
home

the
truth
will
always
haunt
me
even
though
it
set
me
free
and
my
tears
flow
like
the
ocean
as
they
floated
in
the
breeze
they
were
falling
in
slow
motion
and
they
brought
me
to
my
knees
you're
haunting
me
taunting
me
all
in
my
brain
turn
off
the
light
and
now
all
that
remains
fills
me
with
doubt
and
i'm
shouting
your
name
out
loud
why
do
you
wanna
put
me
through
the
pain
i
get
the
feeling
i'll
never
escape
i
can't
hide
away
from
the
shame
of
you
tears

조용히
잠든
방을
열어
기억을
꺼내
들어
부서진
시간
위에서
선명히
너는
떠올라
길
잃은
마음속에
널
가둔
채
살아
그만
그만
멈춘
시간
속
잠든
너를
찾아가
아무리
막아도
결국
너의
곁인
걸
길고
긴
여행을
끝내
이젠
돌아가
너라는
집으로
지금
다시
way
back
home
세상을
뒤집어
찾으려
해
오직
너로
완결된
이야기를
no
i
won't
ever
lose
as
long
as
you're
there
빛이
다
꺼진
여기
나를
안아줘
눈을
감으면
소리
없이
밀려와
이
마음
그
위로
넌
또
한
겹
쌓여가
even
when
we
go
through
changes
even
when
we're
old
remember
that
i
told
you
i'll
find
my
way

cut
deeper
than
a
knife
and
i
gotta
act

on
all
these
memories
like
what
i'd
do
if
you
had
stayed
and
all
the
lies
that
you
betrayed
if
time
stood
still
and
i
could
see
you
again

would
keep
you

there
were
huge
performances

vossi
bop
and
mark
ronson
bringing
miley

be
the
best
gig
i've
ever
played
in
my
life.lewis
even
got
love
from
stiff
chocolate
himself
stormzy

his
new
favourite
artist
which
lewis
said
was
nice
unfortunately
jess
glynne
couldn't
perform
since
she
was
ill
but
the
band
didn't
know
this
they
turned
up
expecting
to
find
jess
and
a
huge
crowd
of
fans
waiting
to
hear
them
but
instead
found
a
booing
crowd
since
they
couldn't
leave
they
headed
into
town
to
watch
aladdin
instead
meanwhile

rain
twenty

have
a
big
house
in
l.a
seems
like
our
future
is
on
the
line
for
my
mistake
i
can't
let
this
fade
away
and
now
we
find
it
hard
to
sleep
and
though
your
body's
next
to
me
i
still
got
far
to
go
i'm
hanging
on
to
hope
say
those
words
you
don't
believe
you
turn
around
and
look
at
me
i
still
got
far
to
go
you're
hanging
on
to
hope
so
good
that
i
don't
deserve
it
so
close
that
it's
almost
perfect
to
be
lying
in
your
arms
even
though
i
broke
your
heart
so
high
for
the
chance
to
fix
this
i’m
wrapped
up
in
your
forgiveness
and
without
you
i
am
nothing
but

feel
like
somebody
with
you
somebody
with
you
somebody

with
you
so
we're
searching
looking
for
ways
we
can
repair
out
of
the
certain
cause
you
know
deep
down
i
care
you
gotta
listen
when
i
tell
you
i'll
be
there

let
us
disappear
