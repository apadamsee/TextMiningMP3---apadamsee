# TextMiningMP3---apadamsee

Here is how to run the program.

All you have to do is do run lyricsmining.py, and it should first output/print the top words & frequencies,
  and below that output/print the top 2-grams and frequencies.
The two print commands are after the last 2 functions in lyricsmining.py and the arguments can be changed to explore the output/findings/data further.



The order the project phases followed was textmining.py, songs.py, then lyricsmining.py.
